Introduction
{% endhint %}

This is a pet plugin that combines texture materials. Pets can participate in battles in the following state. Players can feed and train pets to make them more powerful and allow pets to reach new conditions and evolve into new forms. In addition, it also has a VexView UI. Of course, it is not mandatory to use VexView. You can execute functions through commands.

After the 3.0.0-Beta version, a large number of armorStand are no longer spawn, and the motion animation model is no longer controlled by the armor rack, but by the texture pack. Therefore, don't worry too much about affecting server performance.

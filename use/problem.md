# Common Problem

## The difference between the Java model and the bedrock model

The limitations of Java model production are very large. For example, it can only rotate one angle, each rotation is a multiple of 22.5, and it is very troublesome to make the motion dynamics.

However, there are few restrictions on the production of bedrock models, and the dynamic production of BlockBench visual animation is very simple, requiring [ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/conxeptworks-model-engine%E2%80%94ultimate-entity-model-manager-1-14-1-16-1.79477/) plugin

## Command \[/imipet open\] error

1.VexView plugin version need 2.6.10+  
2.Model ID does not exist, causing VexView UI error

## Texture pack problem

Please read: [Click](../texture-and-model-display/texturemodel.md#常见问题)

## Why model ID does not exist

There are the following situations

* The model configuration is not placed in the \[imiPet/pets\] or \[imiPet/models\] folder
* No reloading after putting into model configuration
* Enter the wrong value, please enter the complete modelId

## I don’t understand the tutorial very well, I can’t learn it

Please keep a serious study attitude

Please do not dare to learn because the tutorial is too long

## Why is there no model displayed

If you use the OptiFine texture pack, it may be because the client does not have the OptiFine Mod installed

If you design by yourself, please carefully check which step is wrong, there must be a reason for everything

If it is designed by others, please give feedback to the designer

## Will it affect server performance?

Since the release of version 3.0.0, some optimizations have been made, which will not cause serious lag problems on the server
